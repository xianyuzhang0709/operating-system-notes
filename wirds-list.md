A modern computer consists of one or more:

processors 处理器

main memory 主存

disks 磁盘

printers 

a keyboard

a mouse

a display

network interface 网络接口

various other input/output devices.



Furthermore, managing all these components and using them optimally is an exceedingly challenging job. For this reason, computers are equipped with a layer of software called the **operating system**, whose job is to provide user programs with a better, simpler, cleaner, model of the computer and to handle managing all the resources just mentioned. OS are subject of this book.



The program that users interact with, usually called the shell when it is text based and the GUI(Graphical User Interface) —— which is pronounced "gooey" —— when it uses icons, is actually not part of the operating system, although it uses the operating system to get its work done.

* 与用户交互的程序，基于文本的叫shell。
* 基于图标的，叫GUI（图形化用户界面）。
* 它们其实都不是操作系统的一部分，只是使用操作系统来完成工作。
